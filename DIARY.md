# Final Year Project Diary

### 24th October 2023:
- There has been a delay in me making my first commit with the goal to initialize my repository.
- The reason for this delay is:
  - I have been busy with other modules and have not had the time to start my project.
  - I have realized the lack of knowledge I have on the implementation of OAuth2.0 and Spring Boot.
  - I have spent the last week researching OAuth2.0 and OpenID connect and how they work with Spring.
- Currently, my highest priority is to complete my Year In Industry Report, which is due on the 31st October 2023.
- The report is 80% of my overall Year In Industry grade.
- My goal for this week up until Sunday the 29th October 2023 is to do the first commit with the Spring Boot Initialized.
- I also want to create a plan of using GitLab's Issue board as a way to track features and bugs.
- By the end of this week, I also want to work on create an ER diagram for my database.
